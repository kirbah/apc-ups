# The Smart Protocol

Despite the lack of official information from APC, this table has been constructed. It's standard RS-232 serial communications at 2400 bps/8N1.

First of all send "Y" command. You should get SM into response.
Some values can be changed in PROG mode only. Send 1..1 with few seconds delay to switch to PROG mode.
