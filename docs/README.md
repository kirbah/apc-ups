# Unofficial APC UPS Protocol Documentation

Welcome to the unofficial documentation for the APC UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply) communication protocol. This project aims to provide a comprehensive and detailed resource for understanding and interacting with APC UPS devices, going beyond the information available in the `apcupsd` manual and other online sources. Whether you're a hobbyist, an IT professional, or a developer working with APC UPS systems, this documentation is designed to help you.

This resource is particularly useful if you need to:

- Monitor the status of your APC UPS.
- Configure advanced settings.
- Develop custom integrations with APC UPS hardware.
- Understand the inner workings of the communication protocol.

Contributions are welcome! See the [Contribution Guidelines](https://kirbah.github.io/apc-ups/Contributing/).

# Disclaimer

Be very careful with all commands provided on this site since you may easily ERASE all configuration on your APC UPS and make it completely unusable. Read documentation and think twice before performing any changes.

# About apcupsd

`apcupsd` is a widely used, open-source daemon for monitoring and managing APC UPS devices. It provides basic functionality for interacting with UPS units, such as reading status information and performing safe shutdowns during power outages.

This project builds upon the information provided in the `apcupsd` manual and other online resources, aiming to offer a more in-depth and comprehensive understanding of the underlying communication protocol used by APC UPS devices. While `apcupsd` provides a practical tool for UPS management, this documentation delves deeper into the protocol itself, enabling more advanced configurations, custom integrations, and a greater level of control over your APC UPS hardware.
