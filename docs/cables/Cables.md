# Cables

You can either use the cable that came with your UPS (the easiest if it is supported) or you can make your own cable. We recommend that you obtain a supported cable directly from APC.

If you already have an APC cable, you can determine what kind it is by examining the flat sides of the two connectors where you will find the cable number embossed into the plastic. It is generally on one side of the male connector.

To make your own cable you must first know whether you have a UPS that speaks the apcsmart protocol or a "dumb" UPS that uses serial port line voltage signalling.
